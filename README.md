# Blood Flow Sensor using Optical Fibres (FBG-based)

This repository contains the MSc thesis project on the development of a novel blood flow sensor using optical fibres and Fibre Bragg Gratings (FBG). The project focuses on creating a minimally invasive, sensitive sensor for real-time blood flow measurement using a phantom flow system and various heating configurations.

## Project Report
- [`Final_thesis_report.pdf`](docs/Final%20thesis%20report.pdf): Full MSc thesis with methodology, results, and future work.

## Key Contributions
- Optical fibre sensor design using FBG
- Silver/PDMS coatings for sensitivity and durability
- 45-degree angled fibre for improved heating
- Phantom flow system with light source testing
- Calibration and MATLAB code for analysis

## Code
- [`pump_calibration_plot.m`](code/pump_calibration_plot.m): MATLAB script to calibrate the peristaltic pump
